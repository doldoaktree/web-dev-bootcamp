     <div>like a raisin in the sun?</div>

        then run?
      </div>
      <div> Does it stink like rotten meat?</div>

        <div> like a heavy load.</div>

      <p>While at a motel in North Dakota, I went to breakfast and sat by a gentleman who was on the phone. I overheard him say that he had “lost time yesterday” because his “passengers got cranky” so he “stopped at a truck stop and hosed them down with cold water.” Then I noticed a school bus in front of the motel that hadn’t been there the day before. When the gentleman ended his call, I asked him if that was his bus. “No,” he replied. “I’m in the back with a semi load of pigs.” —Submitted by David Flemming, Hermantown, Minnesota</p>
